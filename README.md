# ptable-svelte

This is a stupid simple periodic table for the web, written using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). It takes advantage of modern features such as flexbox and CSS grid, and offers a minimalist experience with no clutter or unwanted features, perfect as reference material for class assignments and the like. 

#### Usage

You can access the public version at [ptable.cyborg.cf](https://ptable.cyborg.cf) or self-host it to make any modifications or view it offline. To build it from source,

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or the package manager of your choice (I prefer pnpm).
3. Build it with `npm run build`. The static site should end up in the `public` folder.

If you want to make modifications to it (changing color schemes, etc) I would suggest using `npm run dev` to hot reload changes as you make them.
